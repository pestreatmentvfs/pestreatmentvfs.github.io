<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove since growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement.

<p>Nevertheless, thrips and other insect pests recorded on yellow sticky cards are simpler to observe than on blue sticky cards. Examples of working together organizations include, CEH Wallingford, Forest Research Study, Horticultural Development Company, The International Pesticide Application Research Study Centre, The Nature Museum London, Rothamsted Research Study, and Wye Bugs.</p>

<p>Other persistent and emerging pest problems include vectored human and animal diseases such as West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis and Lyme illness; plant pests and illness such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 toxic water, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest supervisors in the U.S. and in other places, and demand efficient pest management procedures.</p>
