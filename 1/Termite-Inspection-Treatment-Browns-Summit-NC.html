If much of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides must be utilized as the last option, in principle, in some cases they are the very first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of particular endemic or intrusive pests and illness or to safeguard the seed and transplants from typical and consistent pest problems.</p>

<p>Natural opponents can be efficient, and pesticides (chemical substances for controlling pests) are just utilized when alternative choices do not produce the required outcome.
