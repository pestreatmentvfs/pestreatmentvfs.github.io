The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a large number of domestic producers, formulators, service, service providers, and suppliers.</p>
<p>Select the least toxic (or lowest schedule) home pesticide available. Most people usually think of pest control throughout the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to attack their backyards and houses, however, pests understand no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring products.</p>
