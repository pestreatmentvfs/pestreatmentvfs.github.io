Besides regular external spraying, whenever there was believed to be a threat of a pest problem developing, there was no documented or routine pest control program at MTSL at the time of the preliminary audit.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very essential measure owing to the fact that a number of pests are carriers of damaging disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the eradication of a couple of pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While pheromones are absolutely nothing new to pest control-- pest control experts regularly use pheromones traps as a method to keep track of pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new idea. </p>
<p>There are numerous farming practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all methods. This chapter discusses various methods to preserve pest insects at tolerable levels or to put it simply incorporated pest management (IPM).
