Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off because growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement.
