Some pesticides, like space sprays, are quick acting.</p>
<p>A pesticide is specified as a chemical agent used to destroy or control pests. Each type of BT is effective only on one particular insect (or group) and just on insects that in fact eat it. However, that does not indicate you can spray it indiscriminately. We are the only company in the state of Georgia to use both termatrac and infrared T3i innovation to identify pests.</p>
