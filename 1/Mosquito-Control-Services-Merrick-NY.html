<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>16 For traditional farms IPM can reduce environmental and human direct exposure to harmful chemicals, and possibly lower total expenses. IPM lowers hazards by reducing general pesticide use, using least dangerous pesticides when there is a shown need, and taking unique protective procedures to minimize pesticide direct exposure living organisms and the environment.</p>
<p>Pests managed: Yellow traps bring in whiteflies, fruit flies, male winged scales, leafhoppers, fungi gnats, midgets, male winged mealybugs and leafminers, thrips, psyllids, and winged aphids.
