Chemical controls were to be used just after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.</p>
<p>They thought that some qualities of areawide management are incompatible with many standard IRM methods, but suggested that using biologically based control tactics, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, might add to both areawide pest management and IRM. Pesticides are chemicals developed to eliminate or damage pests. Corder Pest Control is a family-owned company that was established on the standard concepts of honesty, stability, and effort. </p>
