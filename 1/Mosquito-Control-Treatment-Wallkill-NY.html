<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as an entire and thinks about a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very crucial measure owing to the fact that a variety of pests are providers of damaging disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the elimination of a couple of pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While pheromones are nothing brand-new to pest control-- pest control specialists often utilize pheromones traps as a means to keep track of pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a brand-new principle.</p>
<p>The many differing hazards from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, routine usage of pesticides is limited to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely centered on cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
