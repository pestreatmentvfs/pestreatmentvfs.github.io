<p>Consider alternative methods (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure. Recent missions for efficient, safe, and enduring pest management programs have actually been targeted mainly towards advancement of brand-new and much better items with which to change standard hazardous pesticides.</p>
