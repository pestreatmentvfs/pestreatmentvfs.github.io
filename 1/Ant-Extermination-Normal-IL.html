<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off due to the fact that growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement.
