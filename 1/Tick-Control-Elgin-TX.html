A pest control company does not just go directly to getting rid of pests.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which allowed regional farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and usage of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic condition, social and ecological effects 13 and is applicable to the majority of farming, public health and feature pest management situations.</p>
