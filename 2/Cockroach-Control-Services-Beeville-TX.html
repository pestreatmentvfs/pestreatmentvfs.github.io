<p>This may include the use of multiple pesticides with different modes of action. Trap crops are planted to hold and attract pest insects where they can be handled more effectively and prevent or reduce their movement onto important crops. Schedules are used to classify pesticides and to control the availability of a product to the public. Termites need moisture for their survival, for this reason wet walls, leak and water seepage are like open invites for them.</p>
<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be big barrier to the development of your business. However, some specialists analyze IPM as turning chemicals from various mode of action groups to keep pest control efficacy and reduce pesticide resistance with a focus on minimizing pest damage. Entomopathogenic nematodes can be used versus specific soil pests, germs, and infections versus pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungis work versus a variety of pests.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as an entire and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses much of the exact same principles as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides. </p>
