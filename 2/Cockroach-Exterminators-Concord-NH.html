<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>WIRES comprehends the Google translation of our site might not be best. This approach refers to using a variety of mechanical or physical strategies for pest exclusion, trapping (in many cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997).
