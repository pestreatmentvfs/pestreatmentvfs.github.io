<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove because growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your facility currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
