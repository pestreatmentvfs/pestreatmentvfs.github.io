<p>The execution of incorporated pest management is advised as a sound judgment technique to pest control in all environments from residential to local, commercial and school settings for both exterior and interior applications. Using physical and mechanical controls in performance with other IPM techniques keeps many types of pest damage low. Our rodent control and exclusion program guarantees that rodent pests not only scurry away but also can't get back in.</p>
<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest effective dosage when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that concentrates on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, environment adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the expense of the control steps.</p>

Understanding how the environment affects pest and crop development is very essential. Many pests can look alike, but might have various ecologies that require various management approaches.</p>
