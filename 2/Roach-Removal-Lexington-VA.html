The company takes emergencies seriously, so if you have a dangerous circumstance, such as a nest of wasps or a scorpion holding you captive in your restroom, Orkin will do its finest to provide same-day service. Because the early potatoes are the only food source available, the beetles will gather on these plants where they can more easily be controlled.</p>
