Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest reliable dosage when other techniques of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, environment manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>

Chemical controls were to be applied just after regular tracking suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the cost of the control steps.</p>
