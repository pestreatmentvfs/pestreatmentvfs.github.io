Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels.

IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, environment manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>

Chemical controls were to be applied just after regular tracking suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the cost of the control steps.</p>
