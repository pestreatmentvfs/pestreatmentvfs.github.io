<p>The idea of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for managing pests, has actually been in practice for a long time.

Freezer is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it a minimum of stops their development and additional feeding on the saved crop.</p>
