D's has actually been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Rather, call HiCare and have our service technicians inspect your homes for white ants and termites. And vice versa, pest management specialists can use video to record and narrate inspections and leave a copy for the facility manager by means of e-mail, or conduct a real-time video co-inspection with the consumer if they are not able to be present at their center during the assessment.</p>
