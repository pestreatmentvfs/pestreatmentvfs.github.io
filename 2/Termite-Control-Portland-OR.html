If all other integrated pest management techniques are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is justified.</p>
<p>Listed below are the rates and charges for bed bug pest control in Chandigarh. Therefore, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural opponents, although helpful in lowering environmental contamination and safety issues, still does not genuinely attend to the environmentally based weakness of the standard pest control method.</p>
