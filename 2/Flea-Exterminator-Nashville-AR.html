<p>This may consist of the use of multiple pesticides with different modes of action. Trap crops are planted to bring in and hold pest insects where they can be managed more efficiently and prevent or lower their motion onto valuable crops. Schedules are used to categorize pesticides and to control the accessibility of an item to the public.
