<p>For some tasks, pest control employees utilize a combination of pest management techniques, a practice called integrated pest management.

The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been effectively utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
