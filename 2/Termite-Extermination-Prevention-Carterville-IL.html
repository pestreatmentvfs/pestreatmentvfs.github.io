<p>Termites are such devastating pests that you desire your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. As soon as action, tracking, and identification limits suggest that pest control is needed, and preventive approaches are no longer effective or offered, IPM programs then evaluate the appropriate control approach both for efficiency and danger. The letter of invitation for this plenary address suggested for its title the central style of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Global Reality".</p>
<p>An extensive understanding of general IPM principles and numerous management options for all possible pest problems is important as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We usually suggest pest control chemicals that do the job using the least quantity of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last hope).

<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of environmentally unsound methods as well as its variety of fundamental strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, pressures of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the possibility that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
