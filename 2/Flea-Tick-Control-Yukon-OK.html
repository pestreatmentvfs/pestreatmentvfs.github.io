If collective efforts were made due to the numerous possible causes for long-lasting and short symptoms and illnesses associated with exposure to pests and pesticides, paperwork would be hard to get even.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management means cautious factor to consider of all readily available plant security methods and subsequent combination of appropriate measures that prevent the development of populations of damaging organisms and keep making use of plant security items and other types of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and lower or minimise risks to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least harmful strategy.</p>
